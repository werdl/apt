# apt
> An alternative frontend to apt, for use on more Linux distros
## package managers
- there are many competing package managers on different distros
- `apt` offers unparalled package amounts, all verified, and all with full support for various tree and dependency features
- `apt-alt` leverages of these files to allow installation on all Linux distros with basic `glibc` support, by tearing apart the .deb file
- this way `dpkg` is not needed
